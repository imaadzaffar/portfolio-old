                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi! I really like to design and make things (eg. this website).</p> 
                <p>I enjoy learning new skills and working on my own projects.</p>
                <p>People who know me know that I like to jump into the deep end and push my limits. I'm always expanding my knowledge into different domains.</p>
                <p>I'm also a bit of a perfectionist - I'll stay up until 2am trying to tweak the colour of a button until it's pixel-perfect.. Not always a good thing lol</p>

                        <h2>Programming</h2>
                        <p>I started programming around 3 years ago. Around Year 8 in school (UK), I was introduced to the Python programming language in Computing lessons and thought it was pretty cool. As I learnt more about the language and the complex things that it enabled, I became really interested in it. This lead me to code extra programs in my spare time, and eventually to the world of App Development. I always thought it would be cool to make a phone app, as we all use our phones everyday, but in my head it seemed to difficult. Around this time, my dad got me a course on Udemy for Android App Development, which I ended up completing (over a long time) and felt confident in the basics of writing apps. To solidify my knowledge, I set out to create my own app. My first ever app was a food ordering app for a family friend's catering business. Even though they didn't end up using it, I learnt a tremendous amount by making this app, including interacting with online databases. I then created a small app for my school, which shows what week it is (A or B). Finally, for my biggest app - Warzone Stats, I developed an app to show player stats for the video game: Call of Duty Warzone. This was very difficult, as I didn't know anything about using 3rd party APIs prior to making it, so I was out of my comfort zone. I'm really glad that I completed this app, as I thought it was really cool and related to something that I enjoy. I went on to learn various other programming languages. I recently got into Web Development and it is something that I am enjoying very much. Also, I took a YouTube course on Python Machine Learning and AI, and I want to delve deeper into this topic in the future.</p>
